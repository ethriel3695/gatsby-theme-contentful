## The Heart of Artemisia

Let it be known throughout the land that there will be an Uprising War in the Barony of 1000 Eyes June 12th through June 16th, 2019. There will be fighting in all forms – heavy, rapier, archery and thrown weapons. Exhibitions of skill, tournaments and competitions to delight the eyes and hearts of the populace both young and old alike will be held for your enjoyment. Merchants aplenty will be displaying their wonderful goods for the satisfaction of your shopping desires. For the intellectual, there will be classes with teachers sharing their expertise and knowledge for those wishing to expand their knowledge of the mind and soul. The nights will be filled with the sounds of music and drums and a joyous noise will be heard by all as we sit around the campfires and celebrate 32 years of Uprising Tradition!

Pets are allowed but must be leashed at all times and we ask that you clean up after them.

## From Their Excellencies:

Welcome to Uprising from Alan and Avelyn, Baron and Baroness of One Thousand Eyes!

The Barony of One Thousand Eyes is proud to present Uprising 33 to Artemisia and the Knowne World! Uprising, once known as The Battle of the Baronies, is one of the oldest events in Artemisia, and most Artemisians have fond memories of past Uprisings. We hope that Uprising 33 will bring more great memories.

There will be much fighting, archery and thrown weapon challenges, GREAT shopping, excellent classes, and the opportunity to meet your old friends, and make new friends.

If you need anything to make your Uprising more fun, get information, or wish to teach a class or sponsor an activity, let the Uprising Steward know. We want to make this as fun as possible for everyone.

Pre-registration is open now! We need the information on attendance, so that you will have enough porta potties and trash bins.

YIS,

Alan and Avelyn

## From the Event Steward:

Greetings from the Autocrat, HE Sheelaegh mac Cathail, who sends a warm Welcome to Uprising War XXXIII!

Lords, ladies, good gentles all! Set aside your mundane troubles, your worries and your woes as you shake off the last remnants of the cold and join Us in The Barony of 1000 Eyes, as once again we host Uprising War. We are so excited that you have chosen to spend your time with Us.

From the arts & sciences to the battlefields, we hope that you will be able to quench your need for fighting, archery, thrown weapons, shopping and discovering new talents and skills. We hope that you are able to renew old friendships and discover new ones while enjoying the merriment and camaraderie that awaits you.

Take some classes, explore some heraldry, watch a battle or two, and do some shopping! Try your hand at something new. Here’s the chance to learn something you always wanted to take a crack at and never had the chance. There’s something for everyone.

We hope that each of you feels the warmth and joy of the hospitality of the Barony and of Our Baron & Baroness.

My staff has worked diligently to bring you the best experience that they can. Please, take a little time out of your war to thank the staff, or better yet, if you see a need or a want and you can, pitch in, if even for just a little. We want everyone to be safe, be courteous, and have fun. I look forward to visiting with you all. Enjoy the War!!

Hears to the Dream,

HE Sheelaegh mac Cathail

#### For fighters, either heavy or rapier, we have planned a number of tournaments and melee scenarios to test your skills and make sure you go back to camp tired and happy after a day on the field. The best part is that most of the scenarios will be the same for Armored and Rapier fighters!

On Thursday at 7pm, we will be having the Annual Chivalry Workshop.

The Chivalry Workshop is specifically designed with two objectives in mind. First, for knights to fight with people they normally don't get to fight with. Artemisia is a big Kingdom, and travel can be tough. The Chivalry Workshop is specifically to help solve this problem, as it's in a central location, and is generally well attended.

The second objective is for knights to help teach others. The knights purposefully don't fight each other. They are there to help develop Artemisia's future fighters. This teaching environment has been very successful for years.

The Unbelted Tournament, Saturday 10am: The annual Unbelted Tournament for Armored Fighters at the Town Eriks.

The Tournament-for-People-Who-Have-Never-Won-a-Tournament Tournament, Saturday 9am: Armored and Rapier lists run simulatneously, so you'll have to make a choice. This is a little tournament to give people who have never prevailed in a tournament the chance to do so. Anyone who has yet to win a tournament in their discipline of choice is eligible to compete.

There will be the usual melee scenarios at the Bridge and Castle, both with and without Combat Archery.

There will be more information and schedule information in the coming weeks.
